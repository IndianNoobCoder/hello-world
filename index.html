            <p class="secSubTag text-small">Secondary education in India is examination-oriented and not course-based:
                students register for and take classes primarily to prepare for one of the centrally-administered
                examinations. Senior school or high school is split into 2 parts (grades 9-10 and grades 11–12) with a
                standardised nationwide examination at the end of grade 10 and grade 12 (usually informally referred to
                as "board exams"). Grade 10 examination results can be used for admission into grades 11–12 at a
                secondary school, pre-university program, or a vocational or technical school. Passing a grade 12 board
                examination leads to the granting of a secondary school completion diploma, which may be used for
                admission into vocational schools or universities in the country or the world. Most reputable
                universities in India require students to pass college-administered admissions tests in addition to
                passing a final secondary school examination for entry into a college or university. School grades are
                usually not sufficient for college admissions in India.</p>

            <p class="secSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.

            <p class="secSubTag text-small">The Midday Meal Scheme is a school meal programme of the Government of India
                designed to improve the nutritional status of school-age children nationwide,by supplying free lunches
                on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in government, government aided, local
                body, Education Guarantee Scheme, and alternative innovative education centres, Madarsa and Maqtabs
                supported under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and National Child Labour Project schools run by the ministry of
                labour. Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centres,
                it is one of the largest in the world.With the twin objectives of improving health and education of the
                poor children, India has embarked upon an ambitious scheme of providing mid day meals (MDM) in the
                government and government-assisted primary schools. The administrative and logistical responsibilities
                of this scheme are enormous, and, therefore, offering food stamps or income transfer to targeted
                recipients is considered as an alternative </p>
